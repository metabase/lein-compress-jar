A Leiningen plugin to compress JARs, pack them with Pack 200, and strip directories, source files, and blacklisted classes using https://github.com/metabase/jar-compression.

Typical usage:

```bash
lein compress-jar resources/modules/vertica.metabase-driver.jar :compression :xz \
  :pack200 '{:classes-to-skip "skipped_files_list.txt"}'
  :out '"resources/modules/vertica.metabase-driver.jar.pack.xz"'
```

All options are passed directly to `jar-compression`'s `compress!`
function; see the [`jar-compression` README](https://github.com/metabase/jar-compression) for a full list
of options. Note that all options are passed to Clojure's reader and parsed; you'll need to use a bit of creative quoting to make sure things are parsed as the appropriate type; see the example above.
